                <p>
                    Often times, mold will show up in a home or business and homeowners may wonder how long it takes to clean up this issue. The answer to this question is a little tricky because there are several factors that determine how long it will take for the mold remediation process to be complete.

                <h3>Step by Step Mold Remediation Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The First Step: During the initial stage of the process, the remediation team will remove any contaminated materials and cordon off any areas that are being treated so no one can enter the area that is being cleaned. Once the team is ready to get to work, they will apply professional cleaning solutions and antimicrobial agents to contaminated areas such as walls and floors. Once this is done, the team will seal off these areas with plastic to prevent spores from re-entering and spreading throughout the home or business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the team will treat any areas that are particularly impacted by mold with special chemicals or techniques such as fogging, UV light, ozone, or blasting. This will take a few days and the team will be sure to stay away from any contaminated areas while the chemicals are being used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the severity of the mold, the team may also apply an encapsulant to certain areas to help with their removal and inhibit future growth. This is especially helpful when there are stubborn mold spores present that cannot be removed by simple biocide treatments or a thorough cleaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the entire process is complete, the team will inspect and ensure that all of the areas that have been contaminated are clean. This will be done by testing for any traces of mold or fungus. If there are any traces of fungus, then the team will reapply the antimicrobial solution or encapsulant to these areas until they are completely clear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once all of the mold is gone, the team will then thoroughly dry the areas that have been contaminated. This can be done by running dehumidifiers, fans or air scrubbers. This is an important part of the cleanup as moisture is one of the key factors in mold spore growth and spreading throughout a property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Remediation Team Will Re-Inspect & Repair Damaged Items Once the contaminated items have been properly disposed of and all areas that have been cleaned are dried, the team will then replace any damaged areas with new ones that have been cleared and repaired. This will help to restore a home or business to its original condition.

                <h3>When It Is Required</h3>
                <p>
                    The most common time that <b>mold remediation</b> will be required is after a major leak or water damage has occurred in a building. This can take a little longer than <b>other types of mold removal</b> due to the fact that the mold needs to be dealt with before it can spread throughout the structure and create further problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to realize that although it is possible to remove mold, there will always be a small number of spores in a home or business that will cause issues for the residents and workers in the building. Luckily, with the proper mold removal procedure, most of these spores will be killed and won’t cause any serious issues. This is why it is so important to hire a certified mold remediation team to handle these issues, as they are trained to properly remove all of the mold spores and make sure that the problem isn’t going to re-occur in the future.
                </p>
